# Type-Ahead Wikipedia Search Lab

## Objectives

1. Put React and unidirectional data to use
2. Use AJAX in a small React library

## Overview

This lesson is very much based on the ideas [here](https://github.com/omcljs/om/wiki/Remote-Synchronization-Tutorial)

Except obviously we'll be doing this in vanilla React.

Student should be able to finish this lab on their own. It's sort of a
culmination of everything they've learned up to this point, so it will likely
be difficult â€” but should hopefully not be impossible.
